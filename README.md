# Avrohugger Plugin for Gradle

A Gradle plugin that compiles [Apache Avro](https://avro.apache.org/docs/1.11.1/) files (```*.avpr, *.avsc, *.avdl```) 
into the corresponding Scala files in your project using the [Avrohugger](https://github.com/julianpeeters/avrohugger).
It has two main functions:
1. Collects all the necessary information for the Avohugger Generator, which generates Scala sources from Apache Avro files.
2. Adds the generated Scala source files to the input of the Scala sourceSet, so that they can be compiled along with your Scala sources.

## Latest Version

The latest version is 1.0.0. It requires at least Gradle 7.2 and Java 8.
- Groovy
```groovy
plugins {
  id 'io.github.kivanval.avrohugger' version '1.0.0'
}
```
- Kotlin
```kotlin
plugins {
  id("io.github.kivanval.avrohugger") version "1.0.0"
}
```

## Development Version

To try out the head version, you can download the source and build it with ```./gradlew publishToMavenLocal```, then in ```settings.gradle```:
```groovy
pluginManagement {
  repositories {
    gradlePluginPortal()
    mavenLocal()
  }
}
```
And in ```build.gradle```:
- Groovy
```groovy
plugins {
  id 'com.google.protobuf' version '1.0.0-SNAPSHOT'
}
```
- Kotlin
```kotlin
plugins {
  id("com.google.protobuf") version "1.0.0-SNAPSHOT"
}
```

## Configuring Avrohugger generation

The Avrohugger plugin assumes that the Apache Avro files (```*.avpr, *.avsc, *.avdl```) 
are organized in the same way as Scala source files, in sourceSets. 
The files generated by the Avrohugger Generator are added to the Scala sources 
before executing ```./gradlew compileScala```.

### Customizing source directories

The plugin adds a new source directory named ```avro``` alongside ```scala``` to every sourceSet. 
By default, it includes all ```*.avpr, *.avsc, *.avdl``` files under ```src/$sourceSetName/avro```. 
You can customize it in the same way as you would customize the scala sources.
```groovy
sourceSets {
    main {
        avro {
            // In addition to the default 'src/main/avro'
            srcDir 'src/main/avro-schemas'
            include '**/*.json'
        }
  }
    test {
        avro {
            // In addition to the default 'src/test/avro'
            srcDir 'src/test/avro-schemas'
        }
    }
}
```

## Sandbox

If you want to manually test the plugin, 
use [sandbox](https://github.com/kivanval/gradle-avrohugger/tree/develop/sandbox) for this purpose.
Run ```./gradlew build``` under the sandbox directory to test it out.
